# Caution

This repo is me trying to work through some unexpected behaviors in a larger system.

Feel free to use anything here as a model, but be aware that I am **not** an experienced Godot programmer at time of writing, and I'm building this to explore problems I'm having. It is very likely that this code is not the best way of doing any of this. If you copy it, you're likely copying the same bugs that prompted me to build this.
